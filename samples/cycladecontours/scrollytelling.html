          <h1>Day 4 - Antikeri to Amargos</h1>
          <p>It was a windy night between the two small islands of Antikeri. Around 4am our skipper had to move the boat as we were drifting towards the shore.
            As this requires turning on the engine, the whole crew had an early start into the day. As a reward for waking up early we got to see a nice sunrise right towards our next destination: the island of Amargos.

          </div>
          <p>After a breakfast and swim we set sail for Katapola, one of the larger towns on Amargos. Luckily the wind and waves always came from the back, giving us a smooth ride.</p>

          <h1>Katapola (Amargos)</h1>
          <p>Thanks to our early start we reached Katapola right after lunch. Because of that there were still plenty of free spots in the marina.
            As always our skipper and first officer on the anchor did a great job parking the boat.

          <p>Amorgos is the easternmost island of the Cyclades island group. It is mostly uninhabited and therefore only has a population of less than 2,000.
            There is a monastery which is situated on the cliff side, dating from the year 812. The 3 main places of tourist accommodations are Katapola, Aegiali and Chora.
            Hiking ways are relatively well maintained. Other activities are scuba diving, activities relating to wellness, and the beaches.

          <p>After a tasty lunch near the marina we decided to rent some scooters and explore the island. There are a bunch of rental places
            right next to the marina that have a range of scooters and quads.
