# Esri European Developer Summit 2019 Presentations

Presentations for the 3D ArcGIS API for JavaScript at the Esri Developer Summit in Berlin, 4.-6. November 2019.

See the [event page](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/agenda/agenda) for the complete agenda.

## Presentations

### [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Getting Started with 3D](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-eu-2019-3D-jsapi/getting-started-with-3d.html)

Sébastien Szollosi, Esri France<br>
Arno Fiva, Esri R&D Center Zürich

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications. This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

### [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Working with Your Data with the Feature Layer](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-eu-2019-3D-jsapi/working-with-feature-layers.html)

Julie Powell, Esri<br>
Arno Fiva, Esri R&D Center Zürich

Explore the capabilities of the feature layer in 2D and 3D that directly connects to your data. In this session you will learn how to create, display, and edit data using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript's FeatureLayer. We will cover styling features, labeling, querying, filtering the displayed data, and configuring a popup. Then you will learn about building an interactive experience using client-side data.

### [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Building Interactive 3D Web Apps Using Open Data](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-eu-2019-3D-jsapi/building-web-apps.html)

Jochen Manegold, Esri Germany<br>
Arno Fiva, Esri R&D Center Zürich

In this session, learn how to build a 3D app using openly available data and the resources provided out of the box by Esri and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Even if your data doesn't contain Z-values, you can build sophisticated 3D apps that leverage modern browser technology to render your 2D features with 3D symbology.

### [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Using Animations](https://esri.github.io/devsummit-eu-2019-3D-jsapi/using-animations.html)

Yannik Messerli, Esri R&D Center Zürich<br>
Arno Fiva, Esri R&D Center Zürich

Animations are a great way to set your web app apart and also make it more informative. In this hands-on session, we will look at the capabilities the API provides out-of-the-box, such as animated camera paths. But there is more: endless possibilities arise when you combine the API with native JavaScript animation facilities. We will provide an overview of frameworks that help you to orchestrate timing and speed. For the brave among us we will hook directly into the WebGL engine to animate 3D models in a scene.
